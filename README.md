#This project is to build a future in where the working person gets to own the company they work for. We want to take the trash of the earth and build with it. We are recycling to build HDPE plastics to build homes, pipelines, and eventually small pods to place out in orbit and to the moon. The possibilities are endless.This is a future of the worker owning a piece of the ever evolving, breathing company The Aethelgard Project.
